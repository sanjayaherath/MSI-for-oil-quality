# MSI-for-oil-quality

## Introduction ##

A project conducted for the final year research. A multispectral imaging system with nine spectral bands(ranging from 400nm-1000nm) was developed for food quality assessment. A study was conducted to assess the quality of coconut oil.

## Project Overview ##

Two studies were carried out to assess the coconut oil quality.
In the first study study coconut oil was adulterated with palm oil, and a functional relationship was developed to map adulteration with a statisitical metric.
In the second study the effect of reuse and reheat of coconut oil was assessed. A spectral clustering based classifier was developed classify different classes of coconut oil.
Two demos are provided in this repository.
